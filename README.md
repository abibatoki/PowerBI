Alex Freberg carried out a survey in 2022 on data professionals to find out their job titles, current annual salary, the industry they work in, their favorite programming language, and lots more. I worked on the project following his guidance in the data analyst boot camp for beginners on YouTube and the following were the key findings from the analysis:

1. The top favorite programming language was Python
2. More than half of the respondents were happy with their work/life balance
3. Most people were not happy with their salary
4. About 7% found it very difficult to get their first data role
5. The top three earners were data scientists, data engineers, and data architects

In this second project, I explored the data from BusinessFinancing.co.uk on the world's oldest businesses: when were they founded, and which industries do they belong to?

Like many business problems, the data is in several different datasets. I used joins to merge the data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.

For visualization purposes, I connected the data on SQL Server to PowerBI and used the DAX function to create new columns: category count and count of businesses.

Key Findings
1. The oldest business in the world was founded back in 578. That's pretty incredible that a business has survived for more than a millennium.

2. Six businesses were founded before 1000.

3. The top 6 oldest companies belong to the following categories: construction, cafe, winery, bar, and two belong to the manufacturing and production of currencies.

4. The oldest businesses are in 6 continents: Asia, Europe, North America, South America, Africa, and Oceania.

5. The category with the highest number of businesses is Banking & Finance, with 17 in Africa.
